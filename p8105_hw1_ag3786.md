**Problem 1**
-------------

We will first create a dataframe containing variables of four different types: (1) random sample of 10 numbers from a uniform distribution between 0 to 5 (2) logical vector indicating whether the numbers from the sample are greater than 2 (3) character variable of length 10, (4) factor variable of length 10

``` r
hw1_df = tibble(
vec_rsamp = runif(n = 10, min = 0, max = 5),
vec_logical = vec_rsamp >= 2,
vec_char = letters[1:10],
vec_factor = rep(c("Male", "Female"), length = 10)
)
```
